# Note taker Tool

## Description

I have taken some pre-built code and built out a Note Taker application that tracks a "Note Title" of a task along with an associated "Note Text" that provides more details about the task.  The functionality is best described as the Note Taker application will track and save notes as a user adds them to the applictaion.  The user then has the ability to seamlessly delete tasks as necessary, by clicking the image of a red trash can associated with the task.

## Usage
